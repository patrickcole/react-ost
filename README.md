# react-OST

## A React application to select and listen to different official soundtracks (OST) through quick YouTube embeds

The goal of this application is to create a quick list of soundtracks that I can listen to while working. It is my intention to build this while learning how to implement `react-router` and `hooks` for data.

### Updates

- Currently no styles have been added to the project, but that is on my list to add next.
