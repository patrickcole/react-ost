# react-OST

## A React application to select and listen to different official soundtracks (OST) through quick YouTube embeds

The goal of this application is to create a quick list of soundtracks that I can listen to while working. It is my intention to build this while learning how to implement `react-router` and `hooks` for data. Through small updates, I am also learning how to use React's context API to handle global state values.

### Updates

- (Sunday June 2, 2019) - Initial styles have now been added to project. These are subject to change. I plan on using CSS Grid to create the overall app layout so that it is flexible for any device size.
- (Tuesday May 21, 2019) - Currently no styles have been added to the project, but that is on my list to add next.
